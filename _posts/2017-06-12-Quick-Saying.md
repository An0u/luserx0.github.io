Eclipse plugin development is horrible, if you don't have satisfying hardware
capable of handling such workflow. Testing my the whole system freeze and
developing anything is super hard, because you can't test the changes you've made
and the lack of a 2nd monitor is killing me. Amazon still doesn't let me sign
in in my account, the support doesn't reply and my order is to be delivered
within this week :(

Tried to *update kawa*\* today, failed, got nerveracked by my machine's inner
handlings and I'm done for the day. 

Hope I can produce more soon,
Harry

\* Searched all around kawa's code cause of some class loading issues after I
changed kawa.jar to 2.92. Currently I think it's working great in the
background, but eclipse's second instance disagrees with me when I reach a
somewhat "launched" state in it
