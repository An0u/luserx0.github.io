Well, the development phase I'm in is not as productive as I anticipated.
Today, I organized the project's github repo a little and updated the README of
my [branch](https://github.com/schemeway/SchemeScript/tree/GSoC-develop).
I'm planning on creating a wiki on GitHub about SchemeScript, but that might
take a couple of weeks to come in life.

Yesterday, I studied the code's dependencies on Kawa and I updated it's version
to the current version(WOW!). But, I couldn't test cause my laptop is
misbehaving a lot. I mean I knew that I was bad with hardware, but not that
much. On other news, Amazon still can't handle my purchase request and I have
contacted support :/

I decided that should automate the one existing test of SchemeScript and Holy
Mentor I can't even understand how [the
thing](https://github.com/schemeway/SchemeScript/blob/GSoC-develop/plugin/tests/indentation-tests.scm) is supposed to run, or if it's
still up to date with how Scheme should act on R7RS and not in R5RS. On the
automation side, I will contact my friend
[Serafeim](https://github.com/serafeimgr) to help me with travis-ci.

Altogether, my hardware is falling short on the project's requirements and I'm
split into studying:
* eclipse documentation
* schemescript src
* debuggers
* open-source documentation
* tricky scheme concepts so as to be close with the language (which is really
  challenging)
* update sites on Eclipse

Hopefully, I found these two bad-boy projects yesterday
* [Angular JS Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/angelozerr/angularjs-eclipse)
* [pmd](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin)

so hope does still exist for XDEBUG.

I also attended [HACKFEST '17](https://www.hackerspace.gr/#/updates/1325663) on
Saturday and got the chance to meet with many wonderful people collaborating in
a thrilling for a developer place [hackerspace
gr](https://www.hackerspace.gr/#), who told me that my project is really
interesting and can help me with every loose tie of my open source developing
experience. I expect to visit hsgr on a daily basis, once I get my new XPS 13.

That's all for (i = 0; i < n; ++i){

} today folks,
Harry
