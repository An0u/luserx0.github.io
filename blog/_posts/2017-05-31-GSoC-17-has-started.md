Greeting people :D

Welcome to thy one and only blog o' mine. Should have built it a while ago, but
the NOKIA internship has put me behind in many aspects of my GSoC responsibilities.

This is the place where I'm gonna record every working day's progress. For now
the blog has one use and that's GSoC reporting.

Let's talk a little about that.
I'm working under GNU's umbrella on the
[Kawa](https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/index.html) project (check it out, you
gotta see it to believe it). My proposal's title was, is and will be "Kawa IDE
integration", which in fact means, that I'm gonna take
[SchemeScript](https://github.com/schemeway/SchemeScript) and get it back in
the game so as to have a well-functioning programming interface for Scheme in
Eclipse. 
How does this have to do with Kawa? Well Kawa is the Scheme implmentation of
choice, where everything on the plugin runs on it.


That's it today folks,
See you soon!
